**Note: The purpose of the project to explore the libraries and learn how to use them. Not to build a SOTA model.**

## Requirements:

This project uses Python 3.8

Create a virtual env with the following command:

```
conda create --name project-setup python=3.8
conda activate project-setup
```

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

### Training

After installing the requirements, in order to train the model simply run:

```
python train.py
```

### Monitoring

Once the training is completed in the end of the logs you will see something like:

```
wandb: Synced 5 W&B file(s), 4 media file(s), 3 artifact file(s) and 0 other file(s)
wandb:
wandb: Synced proud-mountain-77: https://wandb.ai/raviraja/MLOps%20Basics/runs/3vp1twdc
```

Follow the link to see the wandb dashboard which contains all the plots.

### Versioning data

Refer to the blog: [DVC Configuration](https://www.ravirajag.dev/blog/mlops-dvc)

### Exporting model to ONNX

Once the model is trained, convert the model using the following command:

```
python convert_model_to_onnx.py
```

### Inference

#### Inference using standard pytorch

```
python inference.py
```

#### Inference using ONNX Runtime

```
python inference_onnx.py
```

### Docker

Install the docker using the [instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Build the image using the command

```shell
docker build -t inference:latest .
```

Then run the container using the command

```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name inference_container inference:latest
```

(or)

Build and run the container using the command

```shell
docker-compose up
```


### Running notebooks

I am using [Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/install) to run the notebooks.

Since I am using a virtualenv, when I run the command `jupyter lab` it might or might not use the virtualenv.

To make sure to use the virutalenv, run the following commands before running `jupyter lab`

```
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name project-setup
pip install ipywidgets
```
